# TestRetainCountAndBlocks

I have 'come of age' in the ARC era.  But, I took a test on my Obj-C skills lately and ran across this puzzle.  My answer was the simple, obvious and incorrect choice.  To undertand it better I created this test projectand picked it apart until I think I understand it now.  The TestRetainCountAndBlock class contains 2 class methods, one that is uncommented for you to test yourself, and one with my resoning on what is the correct answer.
